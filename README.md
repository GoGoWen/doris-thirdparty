# Alternatives

A fork of com.sleepycat:je:18.3.12 from [bdbje](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/sleepycat/je/18.3.12/je-18.3.12-sources.jar), Applied patches from [StarRocks bdbje](https://github.com/StarRocks/bdb-je/).
Because of  StarRocks bdbje based on version 7.x, Apache Doris use bdbje  base on version 18.x.  So cannot use StarRocks bdb-je directly.
